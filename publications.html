            A working definition of Government as a Platform
           </h3>
           <p>
            There have been a range of narratives circulating around the idea of 'Government as a Platform' since the publication the article of that title by Tim O’Reilly in 2011. The aim of this article is to present such a definition that can bring together a subset of the existing ways people use the term, and hopefully resolve some of the contradictions and emphasize considerations of safety and democratic accountability.

           </h3>
           <p>
            The narrative around “data-sharing” in government needs resetting. It is too often short-hand for the unaccountable duplication and joining together of data to meet short-term policy needs or reduce costs.

          <p>
            'Government as a Platform' normally gets talked about in terms of shared digital capabilities – things like hosting, identity or payments. What is the role of real-world platforms like government offices?

          <p>
            One of the characteristics of today’s digital services is that they operate in real-time. Today, the infrastructure and the data-hygiene does not exist for government to systematically operate in real-time.
